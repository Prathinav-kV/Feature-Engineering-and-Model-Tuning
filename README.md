# Feature-Engineering-and-Model-Tuning

## Project
Featurization, Model Selection & Tuning

The project was accomplished by employing supervised learning, ensemble modelling and unsupervised learning techniques to build and train a prediction model to identify Pass/Fail yield of a particular process entity for a semiconductor manufacturing company.The dataset presented in this case represents a selection of such features where each example represents a single production entity with associated measured features and the labels represent a simple pass/fail yield for in house line testing

## Skills and Tools

Supervised learning, PCA, Feature selection, Model tuning, Grid Search
